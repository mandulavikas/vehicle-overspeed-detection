# Vehicle Overspeed Detection using Raspberry Pi

A real-time overspeed detection system using Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors. This project detects when a vehicle exceeds a predefined speed limit and triggers an alert using a buzzer.

## 🚀 Overview
Designed an overspeed monitoring system using Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors to detect and alert when vehicles exceed predefined speed limits. Implemented real-time data processing and buzzer alerts for safety enforcement.

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 3/4
- 2 x Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer or LED
- Jumper wires, Breadboard

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time speed calculation using distance/time
- Threshold-based overspeed detection
- Buzzer alert for violations
- Expandable for future IoT and cloud features

## 📁 Files Included
- `overspeed_detection.py`: Python code for speed detection
- `circuit_diagram.png`: Schematic diagram of the system
- `Vehicle_Overspeed_Detection_Project_Report.pdf`: Full documentation

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- License plate recognition via camera module
- Data logging to cloud
- SMS/email alert system
